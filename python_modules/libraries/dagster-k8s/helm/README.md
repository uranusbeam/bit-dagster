# Dagster

[Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) is a Python library for building data applications.

## Install Chart

To install the Dagster chart into your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm install --namespace "dagster" dagster dagster-k8s/helm/dagster/
```

After installation succeeds, you can get the chart status with:

```bash
helm status dagster
```

To remove Dagster:

```bash
helm delete dagster
```

The Dagster chart configures a Dagit web host Deployment/Service, Celery worker Deployment, and
various other Kubernetes objects to support executing Dagster pipelines within a Kubernetes cluster.

Currently, this chart also installs RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL Helm charts as dependencies; a future
update of this chart will support "bring your own database/queue" configuration.

## Helm Chart Configuration

Full and up-to-date documentation can always be found in the comments of the `values.yaml` file.

See more detailed notes on configuring environment variables in the section below.

## Environment Variables

We support two ways of setting environment variables: either directly add them to `values.yaml`, or
provide an external ConfigMap/Secret object to mount using `envFrom:` in the chart pods:

- `job_runner.env.SOME_ENV_VAR`: Set `SOME_ENV_VAR` in the Celery Worker and Job pods
- `dagit.env.SOME_ENV_VAR`: Set `SOME_ENV_VAR` in the Dagit pod
- `job_runner.env_config_maps`: names of ConfigMaps to use for environment variables in the
  Celery Worker and Job pods
- `job_runner.env_secrets`: names of Secrets to use for environment variables in the
  Celery Worker and Job pods
- `dagit.env_config_maps`: names of ConfigMaps to use for environment variables in the Dagit pod
- `dagit.env_secrets`: names of Secrets to use for environment variables in the Dagit pod

These will be loaded in the following order, and in the case of conflicts, subsequent loads will
take priority:

1. Base environment; custom env vars specified in `values.yaml`
2. ConfigMap environment variables, loaded in order of the ConfigMaps specified
3. Secret environment variables, loaded in order of the Secrets specified

Thus, for example, if `CUSTOM_ENV_VAR` appears in `values.yaml`, a ConfigMap, and two secrets, the
last secret loaded will be the value of `CUSTOM_ENV_VAR` at runtime.

### Implementation Notes

This chart installs a base pair of Kubernetes ConfigMap objects for environment variables. These
are:

- `dagster-job-runner-env`: Environment variables for the Celery workers and the spawned Job pod
- `dagster-dagit-env`: Environment variables for the Dagit Deployment pod

Each of these ConfigMaps set `DAGSTER_HOME` by default, and also enable user-specification of
additional environment variables directly in `values.yaml`.

Additionally, this Helm chart supports pulling in other external environment variables from external
Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.
