# dagster-k8s

Utilities for running Dagster with Kubernetes. This includes a Python API allowing Dagit to launch
runs as Kubernetes Jobs, as well as a Helm chart you can use as the basis for a Dagster deployment
on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Python API

The `K8sRunLauncher` allows Dagit instances to be configured to launch new runs by starting per-run
Kubernetes Jobs. To configure the `K8sRunLauncher`, your `dagster.yaml` should include a section
like:

```yaml
run_launcher:
  module: dagster_k8s.launcher
  class: K8sRunLauncher
  config:
    image_pull_secrets:
    service_account_name: dagster
    job_image: "my-company.com/image:latest"
    dagster_home: "/opt/dagster/dagster_home"
    postgres_password_secret: "dagster-postgresql-secret"
    image_pull_policy: "IfNotPresent"
    job_namespace: "dagster"
    instance_config_map: "dagster-instance"
    env_config_maps:
    - "dagster-k8s-job-runner-env"
    env_secrets:
    - "dagster-k8s-some-secret"
```

## Helm chart

For local dev (e.g., on kind or minikube):

```shell
helm install \
    --set dagit.image.repository="dagster.io/dagster-docker-buildkite" \
    --set dagit.image.tag="py37-latest" \
    --set job_runner.image.repository="dagster.io/dagster-docker-buildkite" \
    --set job_runner.image.tag="py37-latest" \
    --set imagePullPolicy="IfNotPresent" \
    dagster \
    helm/dagster/
```

Upon installation, the Helm chart will provide instructions for port forwarding Dagit and Flower (if configured).

## Running tests

To run the unit tests:

    pytest -m "not integration"

To run the integration tests, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/),
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#installation),
and [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed.

On macOS:

```
brew install kind
brew install helm
```

Docker must be running.

You may experience slow first test runs thanks to image pulls (run `pytest -svv --fulltrace` for
visibility). Building images and loading them to the kind cluster is slow, and there is
no visibility into the progress of the load.

**NOTE:** This process is quite slow, as it requires bootstrapping a local `kind` cluster with Docker images and the `dagster-k8s` Helm chart. For faster development, you can either:

1. Keep a warm kind cluster
2. Use a remote K8s cluster, e.g. via AWS EKS or GCP GKE

Instructions are below.

### Faster local development (with kind)

You may find that the kind cluster creation, image loading, and kind cluster creation loop
is too slow for effective local dev.

You may bypass cluster creation and image loading in the following way. First add the `--no-cleanup` 
flag to your pytest invocation:

```shell
pytest --no-cleanup -s -vvv -m "not integration"
```

The tests will run as before, but the kind cluster will be left running after the tests are completed.

For subsequent test runs, you can run:

```shell
pytest --kind-cluster="cluster-d9971c84d44d47f382a2928c8c161faa" --existing-helm-namespace="dagster-test-95590a" -s -vvv -m "not integration"
```

This will bypass cluster creation, image loading, and Helm chart installation, for much faster tests.

The kind cluster name and Helm namespace for this command can be found in the logs, or retrieved via the respective CLIs, using `kind get clusters` and `kubectl get namespaces`. Note that for `kubectl` and `helm` to work correctly with a kind cluster, you should override your kubeconfig file location with:

```shell
kind get kubeconfig --name kind-test > /tmp/kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig
```

#### Manual kind cluster setup
The test fixtures provided by `dagster-k8s` automate the process described below, but sometimes its useful to manually configure a kind cluster and load images onto it.

First, ensure you have a Docker image appropriate for your Python version. Run, from the root of
the repo:

```shell
./.buildkite/images/docker/test_project/build.sh 3.7.6
docker tag dagster-docker-buildkite:latest \
    dagster.io.priv/dagster-docker-buildkite:py37-latest
```

In the above invocation, the Python majmin version should be appropriate for your desired tests.

Then run the following commands to create the cluster and load the image. Note that there is no
feedback from the loading process.

```shell
kind create cluster --name kind-test
kind load docker-image --name kind-test dagster.io/dagster-docker-buildkite:py37-latest
```

If you are deploying the Helm chart with an in-cluster Postgres (rather than an external database),
and/or with dagster-celery workers (and a RabbitMQ), you'll also want to have images present for
rabbitmq and postgresql:

```shell
docker pull docker.io/bitnami/rabbitmq
docker pull docker.io/bitnami/postgresql

kind load docker-image --name kind-test docker.io/bitnami/rabbitmq:latest
kind load docker-image --name kind-test docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:latest
```

Then you can run pytest as follows:

```shell
pytest --kind-cluster=kind-test
```


### Faster local development (with an existing K8s cluster)
If you already have a development K8s cluster available, you can run tests on that cluster vs. running locally in `kind`. 

For this to work, first build and deploy the test image to a registry available to your cluster. For example, with ECR:

```
./.buildkite/images/docker/test_project/build.sh 3.7.6
docker tag dagster-docker-buildkite:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dagster-k8s-tests:2020-04-21T21-04-06

aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-west-1 | sh
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dagster-k8s-tests:2020-04-21T21-04-06
```

Then, you can run tests on EKS with:

```
export DAGSTER_DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG="2020-04-21T21-04-06"
export DAGSTER_DOCKER_REPOSITORY="$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"
export DAGSTER_DOCKER_IMAGE="dagster-k8s-tests"
 
# First run with --no-cleanup to leave Helm chart in place
pytest --cluster-provider="kubeconfig" --no-cleanup -s -vvv 

# Subsequent runs against existing Helm chart
pytest --cluster-provider="kubeconfig" --existing-helm-namespace="dagster-test-<some id>" -s -vvv
```

### Validating Helm charts

To test / validate Helm charts, you can run:

```shell
helm install dagster --dry-run --debug helm/dagster
helm lint
```

### Enabling GCR access from Minikube

To enable GCR access from Minikube:

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry element-dev-key \
    --docker-server=https://gcr.io \
    --docker-username=oauth2accesstoken \
    --docker-password="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    --docker-email=my@email.com
```

## A note about PVCs

Both the Postgres and the RabbitMQ Helm charts will store credentials using Persistent Volume
Claims, which will outlive test invocations and calls to `helm uninstall`. These must be deleted if
you want to change credentials. To view your pvcs, run:

    kubectl get pvc

## Testing Redis

The Redis Helm chart installs w/ a randomly-generated password by default; turn this off:

```
helm install dagredis stable/redis --set usePassword=false
```

Then, to connect to your database from outside the cluster execute the following commands:

```
kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/dagredis-master 6379:6379
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
```
