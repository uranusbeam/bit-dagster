    '''Abstract base class for storing pipeline run history.
    
    Note that run storages using SQL databases as backing stores should implement
    :py:class:`~dagster.core.storage.runs.SqlRunStorage`.

    Users should not directly instantiate concrete subclasses of this class; they are instantiated
    by internal machinery when ``dagit`` and ``dagster-graphql`` load, based on the values in the
    ``dagster.yaml`` file in ``$DAGSTER_HOME``. Configuration of concrete subclasses of this class
    should be done by setting values in that file.
