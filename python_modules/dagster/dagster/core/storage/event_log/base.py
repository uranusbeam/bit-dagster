    Note that event log storages using SQL databases as backing stores should implement
    :py:class:`~dagster.core.storage.event_log.SqlEventLogStorage`.

    Users should not directly instantiate concrete subclasses of this class; they are instantiated
    by internal machinery when ``dagit`` and ``dagster-graphql`` load, based on the values in the
    ``dagster.yaml`` file in ``$DAGSTER_HOME``. Configuration of concrete subclasses of this class
    should be done by setting values in that file.
