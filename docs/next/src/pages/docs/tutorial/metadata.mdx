# Metadata and custom type checks

Custom types can also yield metadata about the type check. For example, in the
case of our data frame, we might want to record the number of rows and columns
in the dataset when our type checks succeed, and provide more information
about why type checks failed when they fail.
User-defined type check functions can optionally return a <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" /> object
that contains metadata about the success or failure of the type check.
Let's see how to use this to emit some summary statistics about our DataFrame
type:

```python literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/custom_types_4.py
caption:custom_types_4.py
lineno-start:17
lines:17-29
emphasize-lines:3-9, 33-53
```

A <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" displayText="TypeCheck" /> must include a
`success` argument describing whether the check
passed or failed, and may include a description and/or a list of <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> objects.
You should use the static constructors on <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> to
construct these objects, which are flexible enough to support arbitrary metadata in JSON or Markdown format.

Dagit knows how to display and archive structured metadata of this kind for
future review:

Custom type checks and metadata are appropriate for checking that a value will
behave as we expect, and for collecting summary information about values.
