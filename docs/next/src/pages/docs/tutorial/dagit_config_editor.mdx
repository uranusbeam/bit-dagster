# Using the Dagit config editor

Dagit provides a powerful, schema-aware, typeahead-enabled config editor to
enable rapid experimentation with and debugging of parameterized pipeline
executions. As always, run:

```bash
$ dagit -f inputs.py -n inputs_pipeline
```

Notice that no execution plan appears in the bottom pane of the Playground.

Because Dagit is schema-aware, it knows that this pipeline now requires
configuration in order to run without errors. In this case, since the pipeline
is relatively trivial, it wouldn't be especially costly to run the pipeline
and watch it fail. But when pipelines are complex and slow, it's invaluable to
get this kind of feedback up front rather than have an unexpected failure deep
inside a pipeline.

Recall that the execution plan, which you will ordinarily see above the log
viewer in the **Execute** tab, is the concrete pipeline that
Dagster will actually execute. Without a valid config, Dagster can't construct
a parametrization of the logical pipeline -- so no execution plan is available
for us to preview.

Here you can see all of the sections available in the environment dict. Don't
worry, we'll get to them all later.

Let's enter the config we need in order to execute our pipeline.

Note that as you type and edit the config, the config minimap hovering on the
right side of the editor pane changes to provide context -- so you always know
where in the nested config schema you are while making changes.
