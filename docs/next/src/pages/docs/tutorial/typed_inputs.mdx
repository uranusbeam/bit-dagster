# Type-checking inputs

Note that this section requires Python 3.

If you zoom in on the **Explore** tab in Dagit and click on one
of our pipeline solids, you'll see that its inputs and outputs are annotated
with types.

By default, every untyped value in Dagster is assigned the catch-all type <PyObject module="dagster" object="Any" />.
This means that any errors in the config won't be surfaced until the pipeline
is executed.

For example, when we execute our pipeline with this config, it'll fail at
runtime:

```YAML literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/inputs_env_bad.yaml
caption:inputs_env_bad.yaml
```

When we enter this mistyped config in Dagit and execute our pipeline, you'll
see that an error appears in the structured log viewer pane of the **Execute**
tab:

Click on "View Full Message" or on the red dot on the execution step that
failed and a detailed stacktrace will pop up.

It would be better if we could catch this error earlier, when we specify the
config. So let's make the inputs typed.

A user can apply types to inputs and outputs using Python 3's type annotation
syntax. In this case, we just want to type the input as the built-in{' '}
`str`.

```python literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/inputs_typed.py
caption:inputs_typed.py
lineno-start:6
lines:6-12
emphasize-lines:2
```

By using typed input instead we can catch this error prior to execution, and
reduce the surface area we need to test and guard against in user code.
