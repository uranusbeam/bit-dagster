# Hello, cereal!

If you're new to Dagster, we recommend working through this tutorial to become
familiar with Dagster's feature set and tooling, using small examples that are
intended to be illustrative of real data problems.

We'll build these examples around a simple but scary .csv dataset,
`cereal.csv`, which contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast
cereals. You can find this dataset on [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagster-io/dagster/master/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv). Or,
if you've cloned the dagster git repository, you'll find this dataset at
`dagster/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv`.

To get the flavor of this dataset, let's look at the header and the first five
rows:

```CSV literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv
caption:cereal.csv
lines:1-6
```
