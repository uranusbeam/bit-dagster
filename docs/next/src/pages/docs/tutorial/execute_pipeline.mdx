# Executing our first pipeline

Assuming you've saved this pipeline as `hello_cereal.py`, we can
execute it via any of three different mechanisms:

1. From the command line, using the `dagster` CLI.
2. From a rich graphical interface, using the `dagit` GUI tool.
3. From arbitrary Python scripts, using dagster's Python API.

## Using the dagster CLI to execute a pipeline

From the directory in which you've saved the pipeline file, just run:

```bash
$ dagster pipeline execute -f hello_cereal.py -n hello_cereal_pipeline
```

You'll see the full stream of events emitted by dagster appear in the console,
including our call to the logging machinery, which will look like:

```bash
2019-10-10 11:46:50 - dagster - INFO - system -
a91a4cc4-d218-4c2b-800c-aac50fced1a5 - Found 77 cereals
    solid             = "hello_cereal"
    solid_definition  = "hello_cereal"
    step_key          = "hello_cereal.compute"
```

Success!

## Using dagit to execute a pipeline

To visualize your pipeline (which only has one node) in dagit, from the
directory in which you've saved the pipeline file, just run:

```bash
$ dagit -f hello_cereal.py -n hello_cereal_pipeline
```

You'll see output like

```bash
Loading repository... Serving on http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

You should be able to navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/pipeline/hello_cereal_pipeline/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/pipeline/hello_cereal_pipeline/) in your web browser and view your pipeline.
It isn't very interesting yet, because it only has one node.

Click on the "Playground" tab and you'll see the two-paned view below.

![hello_cereal_figure_two.png](/assets/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_two.png)

The top pane is empty here, but in more complicated pipelines, this is where
you'll be able to edit pipeline configuration on the fly.

The bottom pane shows the concrete execution plan corresponding to the logical
structure of the pipeline -- which also only has one node,{' '}
`hello_cereal.compute`.

Click the "Start Execution" button to execute this plan directly from dagit. A
new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the
stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

(If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to
allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1 -- or, just navigate to the "Runs" tab to see
this, and every run of your pipeline.)

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to your
pipeline run.

## Using the Python API to execute a pipeline

If you'd rather execute your pipelines as a script, you can do that without
using the dagster CLI at all. Just add a few lines to
`hello_cereal.py`

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=26
file:/intro_tutorial/hello_cereal.py
caption:hello_cereal.py
lines:26-28
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
$ python hello_cereal.py
```

The <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" displayText="execute_pipeline()" /> function
called here is the core Python API for executing Dagster pipelines from code.
