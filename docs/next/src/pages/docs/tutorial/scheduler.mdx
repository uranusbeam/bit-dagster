# Scheduling pipeline runs

Dagster includes a simple built-in scheduler that works with Dagit for
control and monitoring. Suppose that we need to run our simple cereal
pipeline every morning before breakfast, at 6:45 AM.

## Requirements

You'll need to install the `dagster-cron` library.

```bash
$ pip install dagster-cron
```

You must also ensure that `cron` is installed on the machine you're
running the scheduler on.

## Pipeline

```python literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/scheduler.py
caption:scheduler.py
lines:1-34
```

As before, we've defined some solids, a pipeline, and a repository.

## Defining the scheduler

We first need to define the Scheduler on our <PyObject module="dagster.core.instance" object="DagsterInstance" />. For
now, the only implemented scheduler is <PyObject module="dagster_cron" object="SystemCronScheduler"/>,
but this is pluggable (and you can write your own). To use the scheduler, add the following lines to your
`$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml`:

```yaml
scheduler:
  module: dagster_cron.cron_scheduler
  class: SystemCronScheduler
```

## Defining schedules

Now we'll write a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to
define the schedule we want. We pass the `cron_schedule` parameter to this class to define when the pipeline
should run using the standard cron syntax; the other parameters
determine other familiar aspects of how the pipeline will run, such as
its config.

We wrap the schedule definition in a function decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="schedules" displayText="@schedules" />

```python literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/scheduler.py
caption:scheduler.py
lineno-start:38
lines:36-45
```

To complete the picture, we'll need to extend the `repository.yaml`
structure we've met before with a new key, `scheduler`.

```YAML literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/scheduler.yaml
caption:scheduler.yaml
```

## Starting schedules

Whenever we make changes to schedule definitions using the
`SystemCronScheduler`, we need to run `dagster schedule up`. This
utility will create, update, or remove schedules in the underlying
system cron file as appropriate to assure it is consistent with the
schedule definitions in code.

To preview the changes, first run:

```bash
$ dagster schedule up --preview -y scheduler.yaml
Planned Changes:
  + good_morning (add)
```

After confirming schedule changes are as expected, run:

```bash
$ dagster schedule up -y scheduler.yaml
Changes:
  + good_morning (add)
```

Verify that the `good_morning` scheduled job has been added to `cron`:

```bash
$ crontab -l
```

If the `good_morning` job is not listed, you may have to start it with:

```bash
$ dagster schedule start good_morning
```

Now, we can load dagit to view the schedule and monitor runs:

```bash
$ dagit -y scheduler.yaml
```

## Cron filters

If you need to define a more specific schedule than cron allows, you can
pass a function in the `should_execute` argument to <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" />.

For example, we can define a filter that only returns _`True`_
on weekdays:

```python
import datetime

def weekday_filter():
    weekno = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()
    # Returns true if current day is a weekday
    return weekno < 5
```

If we combine this _should_execute_ filter with a
_cron_schedule_ that runs at 6:45am every day, then we'll
have a schedule that runs at 6:45am only on weekdays.

```python
good_weekday_morning = ScheduleDefinition(
    name="good_weekday_morning",
    cron_schedule="45 6 * * *",
    pipeline_name="hello_cereal_pipeline",
    environment_dict={"storage": {"filesystem": {}}},
    should_execute=weekday_filter,
)
```
