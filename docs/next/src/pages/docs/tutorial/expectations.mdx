# Expectations

But sometimes we want to make more specific, data- and business
logic-dependent assertions about the semantics of values. It typically
isn't appropriate to embed assertions like these into data types
directly.

For one, they will usually vary substantially between instantiations --
for example, we don't expect all data frames to have the same number of
columns, and over-specifying data types (e.g., `SixColumnedDataFrame`)
makes it difficult for generic logic to work generically (e.g., over all
data frames).

What's more, these additional, deeper semantic assertions are often
non-stationary. Typically, you'll start running a pipeline with certain
expectations about the data that you'll see; but over time, you'll
learn more about your data (making your expectations more precise), and
the process in the world that generates your data will shift (making
some of your expectations invalid.)

We've already encountered the <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" /> event,
which is typically yielded by the type machinery (but can also be
yielded manually from the body of a solid's compute function); <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" /> is
another kind of structured side-channel result that a solid can yield.
These extra events don't get passed to downstream solids and they aren't used to
define the data dependencies of a pipeline DAG.

```

Until now, every solid we've encountered has returned its result value,
or `None`. But solids can also yield events of various types for
side-channel communication about the results of their computations.

Running this pipeline yields an <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" /> with
`success` set to `False` since we expect entries in
the `calories` column to be of type `int` but they are of type `string`.
We note that this precedes our incorrect result that the least caloric
cereal is Corn Flakes (100 calories per serving) and the most caloric
cereal Strawberry Fruit Wheats (90 calories per serving).

To fix this, we can cast `calories` to `int` during the hydration
process:

```python literalinclude startLine=74 emphasize-lines=6
file:/intro_tutorial/custom_types_5.py
caption:custom_types_5.py
lines:74-83
```

Running this pipeline yields an <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" /> with
`success` set to `True` and the correct result that
the least caloric cereal is All-Bran with Extra Fiber (50 calories per
serving) and the most caloric cereal is Mueslix Crispy Blend (160
calories per serving).

This part of this system remains relatively immature, but yielding
structured expectation results from your solid logic means that in
future, tools like Dagit will be able to aggregate and track expectation
results, as well as implement sophisticated policy engines to drive
alerting and exception handling on a deep semantic basis.
